[View the live project here.](https://nickl98.github.io/MS2)

For this project I decied to make a fun lttle matching game with diffrent types of technology you come across in your day-to-day life. 
It's not the hardest game you may come across however, the cards change location everytime you start over. Well, enjoy the low-tech music, take a break nd enjoy the game.

    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. I wanted to have users imagine what point we are trying to make with our service. Giving users is an important goal.
